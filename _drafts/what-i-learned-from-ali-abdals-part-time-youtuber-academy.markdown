# Why do YouTube?

- Architect or achaeologist - don't plan in advance what you think your channel should be. 99% of people would be best served by digging in the areas that seem interesting to them. Most of the time you won't find anything. Every now and again you will notice something interesting. Dig deeper there, see what you find.
- It took Ali 90 videos to get to 1000 subcribers and 4000 hours of watch time. This will not be overnight.
- Don't do this because you heard someone with 2 million followers can make 50k a month. Do this because you learn how to communicate effecticley, how to operate a camera, you refine your presentation skills, you learn how to talk to camera. You can grow as a person and gain skills that help all your other projects in life.
- Who am I and what do I want
- What would I enjoy talking about
- What are my unfair advantages - leaning into it, that other people don't have
- Who is my potential audience and what do they want? Who would resonate with my stuff?

## Fear

- Nobody cares 
- You're not committing to doing this for the rest of your life
- See if you enjoy the process
- If it goes wrong, you can just close the channel 

## Brainstorm ideas

- List out your vibe, your audience
- Well thought out, informed, effective
- Get video ideas by looking at others channels too
- Product Reviews
- Beginner learns... series
- How I am learning to, why I am learning to
- Essential gear

Level 1 - make one video at a time, each one is a struggle

Level 2 - making a video a week, not worried about quality but quantity

Level 3 - make one good quality video a week

> "The point of these videos is not to grow my youtube channel, the point of these early videos is to grow my own abilities at making videos"

- My first videos are for me, learning how to make videos
- Once you've made 50 videos, they will all suck. You would not expect to buy the painting of someone who has never painted before. Your first 50 videos are for you. The next 50 are for your audience. Nobody gives a shit about your content at the start, but it helps you develop your skills. As a bonus, maybe someone will subscribe.

## Script your video

> "Most pro YouTubers do their title and thumbnail way before they film the video. &nbsp;Most beginner YouTubers film the video first, and they think about the title and thumbnail as they're uploading the video.‚Äù

- There is a spectrum - fully scripted to off the cuff
- Worth doing structure, and bullet points, but not word for word
- Write out top level chapter bullet points
- Write sub bullet points per section
- You want your end screen to point them to another video

## Filming

Frame the shot so that you are:

- 45 degrees from a light source, like a window - big soft lighting
- Lines in the bacground are straight - i.e. camera is straight on, not up or down at an angle
- Look at the camera
- Audio quality! Get an external mic, and get it close to your mouth

## Background

- This is a cherry on top
- Lamp, bookshelf, plant - this is the holy trinity 

## Thumbnails

- Remember the iPhone can shoot in 16:9 aspect ratio! Just tap the arrow at the top of the camera and change from 4:3 to 16:9
- Take 50 plus photos, put the camera on a tripod, one will work!
- Try different shots - over the top, headshots, photos of you holding the product etc
- The vibe of your thumbnail attracts your tribe
- You don't have to do the 

## Grow your channel

- How good is your video? How many people click on it, how many finish it?
- Don't make your videos better for the algorithm, make them better for the viewer
- Don't mis-sell your video with a false thumbnail. If the screenshot is a ferrari, and then your video is talking about books, it's a false promise & people will leave. Set their expectations
- You won't get growth whilst your videos are rubbish.
- Go for quantity over quality 
- Go after search traffic
- 10 Productivity Tips is totally the worst way to go about starting - you won't win that format. But if you carve out a niche, nobody has reviewed the Le Crueset Dutch Oven x Harry Potter - boom, now you're starting
- Spend intentional time on YouTube - doing market research, looking at editing style, bacground music, colour grading, storytelling - what are the aspects of other peoples channels that you like
- If cooking is your niche, know the top 50-100 channels, and work out what works well. What's their view to subscriber ratio, what made their most popular video so popular, can you reverse engineer the success of it. Intentionally consume.
- Most people give up after a few weeks or months - don't stop before you let compounding run its course 
- Look out for Creator - Market Fit - it will take time to throw spaghetti at the wall
- Don't obsess over analytics until you have 5k followers - it's much better to spend time on making a better video 

## Tops Tips

- Once you upload your first video, you realise nobody gives a crap
- Success = work x luck x unfair advantage
- Unfair advantage can be money (gear, outsourcing editing), but also using your credibility and expertise. Imagine trying to write a high quality blog post in mandarin, or trying to become a guitar teacher - if you don't have these skills. 
- Are you trying to make Netflix level documentaries, or just sit down in front of a camera and share interesting stuff from your life and your views?
- Who will make a better photo - somebody who takes one photo a day for 30 days, or someone who spends 30 days taking 1 perfect photo?
- Make 100 videos, then worry about the quality. You will naturally improve over 100 videos.
- Don't worry about your niche - let it emerge over time. Nobody watches the videos at the start anyway.
- Think in terms of systems. You have to start with 1 video at a time. Progress towards generating lots of ideas, refining them into thumbnails, creating them in parrallel, and plan out your content calendar. What if you could batch film 5 videos in a day. The E-myth revisted applies to being a creator! Don't think 1 video at a time.
- Your first 50 videos are for you - so just focus on learning. Your next 50 videos are for your audience.
- If you publish a video every week for the next two years, fundamentally your life will change. Upload once a week, and aim for marginal improvements.
