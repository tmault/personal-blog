Published by David Seah, the Compact Calendar condenses a full calendar year down to a single sheet of A4 paper. They're great for visualising project milestones, commitments, or just plotting out your focus over the coming 12 months.

I have quickly put together a UK specific version using the bank holiday dates published at https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays.

Here are links to download the files:

  * PDF 12 month calendar
  * PDF 18 month calendar
  * Excel version if you want to tweak the colours, style, or change the start dates.



The original documents are available at https://davidseah.com/node/compact-calendar/.
