## Considering TCO & Cost Per Use

Plugging together a financial case using investment costs, maintenance costs, lifespan, intangible and tangible benefits, are some of the bread & butter calculations for a business analyst.

In the workplace, using simple mathematics and logic can help you work out the expected impact of a ten million dollar investment in technology, or impact assess an organisational change to a 50,000 organisation. These tools and approaches to evaluating a course of action are just as useful at home as they are in the workplace.

## A quick example of napkin math TCO

At home, I often like to consider the Total Cost of Ownership of an item. It doesn't have to be in complex ways - often it can be some basic napkin math.

As an example, maybe a part on my bike needs replacing. Let's say I need a new bottom bracket. The part costs £20, and it's a quick job, so it might cost say £10 in labour to get it done at a bike shop.

I could take the bike into a shop and get it replaced. Alternatively, I could spend £20 on the part myself, £30 on the tools needed.

How does this play out? Spending a little bit more initially will be cheaper over the long run:

Anyway, here I am talking about cycling when this was meant to be a post about using basic business analysis tools to save the environment, pad my wallet, and claw back some precious time.

## The Problem: Dawdling in the shower

I have a problem, and I know how it happens. I spend far too long in the shower. It's warm, comfortable, relaxing, and before I know it I am daydreaming, planning my day, thinking through anything and everything. It's a terrible habit, wasting water, time, and money.

I admit I have been negligent for far too long, and I can feel the tide of growing awareness of our environmental impact in our society, so I decided to do something about it.

## So, how much water does a shower use?

An average showerhead uses 12 litres of water per minute Source: waterwise.org.uk. This fact alone was enough to make me start thinking about changing my behaviour. When I visualise that volume of water - 12-litre bottles poured down the drain for every minute in the shower - it's suddenly viscerally wasteful.

## Pulling out the calculator to baseline the problem

Brace yourself. It's bad. I know I can often spend fifteen or twenty minutes in the shower each morning daydreaming. Bad. I know. I warned you.

### Time

Let's take twenty minutes as an average. Twenty minutes a day adds up to 140 minutes a week. That's 7280 minutes, or 121 hours annually. Whoops. 5 days a year in the shower. I'm sure I could find a better use for that time.

### Water

Assuming a shower head is outputting 12 litres a minute, over a twenty-minute shower that 240 litres a day. That comes to 1680 litres a week, or 87,360 litres a year. Yikes.

### Money - putting a price on all that water

In my area, home water is charged per cubic metre (1000 litres) at 131.18 pence per m^3.

So (87,360 litres a year / 1000) * 131.18 = 114,598.848 pence or £1145 a year on water.

5 days a year, over £1k, and 80,000 litres wasted. Change is needed.

# Finding a Solution

Once you have a baseline of a situation, the fun begins. You can now begin adjusting and amending variables to see what the impact is on the TCO.

Here are some of the variables I could play with:

  * Reduce the flow rate of water out of the Shower Head
  * Reduce the amount of time I spend in the shower or the frequency
  * Reduce the cost per unit of water



Some of these I was not willing (frequency) or able to (cost per unit) amend. I think the clear source of the problem is the amount of time spent in the shower, so I decided to tackle that variable and aim to reduce it down to sub-5-minute showers.

## Making Behavioural Change Stick

I tried telling myself to be faster in the shower, and I found that might work for a day or two, but sooner or later I find myself slipping back to my old habits. It just wasn't working. It was easier to fall back to my old thinking patterns and indulge the daydream.

## Making the cost of my behaviour apparent

Losing track of time is a big part of the problem, so I thought I try putting a clock or timer in the shower. Armed with my new knowledge of how much water was used per minute, the cost, and the fact that I was on track to spend 5 days of each year in the shower, this worked.

A simple £16.99 electronic shower timer has served the job perfectly.

Suddenly, spending 5 minutes or less in the shower has become a game. The shower timer which I purchased has an awful piercing alarm noise - which on its own seems to be enough to motivate me to finish the shower and turn the alarm off before I have to hear it.

By cutting down showers from 20 minutes to 5 minutes per day, per year it will save:

  * £856 a year on water bills
  * 65,520 litres of water
  * 3.75 days of time



For fun, spending £16.99 to save £856 is equivalent to a 4938.26% annual ROI. If only I could find an asset that could return that kind of ROI... alas for now I will have to settle for being the wannabe Warren Buffett of shower ROIs.
