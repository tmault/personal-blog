‍ **Public Service Announcement** : Do not use a USB C hub to power a Mac M1 laptop. **Update Feb 2021** : This was fixed in macOS 11.2.2 \- ignore this post!  


I did this, and it fried my brand new mac. It no longer turns on. Apple has taken the device away to repair.  


A google search confirms that many people have the same problem, and the only fix is for Apple to repair the devices.

  


![](/assets/images/2023/01/image-11.png) _I was pretty shocked to find this is happening to a lot of people. The first forum thread contains loads of reports of the exact same fault I experienced._

Check out this forum on MacRumours for more information – there are multiple reports of people experiencing the same problem since. These devices are only a few weeks old - this should not be happening!  


Apple guidance is to only power the MacBook with the original charger plugged directly into the MacBook.   


When I get my M1 back from Apple I plan to adhere to their advice. Sure it will be a minor inconvenience to plug the original power cable in and a separate USB C hub, but that’s less of an inconvenience than frying my laptop!
