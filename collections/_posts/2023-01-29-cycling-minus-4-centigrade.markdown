excerpt: Nailing cycling gear for cold weather is tough - start warm and you'll be sweating too much, start too cold and you might be miserable all ride.

I just got back from a bike ride in minus -4Â°C. I was so close to being dressed correctly.

I had on a slightly ridiculous list of clothes:

  * Bib tights
  * Extra long socks
  * Spatz Roadman overshoes
  * Spatz Thermos Gloves
  * Normal summer cycling shoes
  * Merino Wool base layer
  * Long sleeve jersey
  * Spatz rainwear arm warmers - these are amazing! There are thicker panels on the front to keep the wet and cold out
  * HUUB jacket
  * Gilet
  * Balaclava 
  * Neck buff
  * Sunglasses



## How'd it fare?

### Tops

After 2.5 hours, the base layer and jersey were pretty soaked with sweat.

I have some Spatz Base layers on order which are meant to be far better at wicking sweat and warmer, so I think the idea is you can wear fewer layers, which lets sweat evaporat, and stay warm and dry.

### Gloves

My hands were pretty cold at the start and went numb - so just wearing the Spatz Thermos Gloves is not enough. 

Some ideas to try:

  * Adding a merino wool / thin glove as a base layer
  * Adding a big pair of skiing mittens over the Spatz gloves
  * Adding [Barmitts](http://barmitts.com) for the winter 



### Feet

Damn, they finally got cold. I thought the Spatz Roadman overshoes were invicible.

Some ideas:

  * Winter shoes - my summer cycling shoes are covered in wents, most of these are covered by the Spatz but I guess this would help keep the cold out
  * Adding another pair of toe warmers under the Spatz overshoes
  * Charcoal warmers
