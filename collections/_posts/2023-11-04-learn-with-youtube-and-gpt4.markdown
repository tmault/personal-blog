GPT4 gives you access to a Plugin store, and the Video Captions plugin can be used to feed the captions from YouTube videos into your prompt.

This is such a neat time saver for scanning a video and making a judgement call on whether you want to watch it.

Here's an example video I used this on from Oliur, a UK based creative who has an awesome video style and has self-built a great of a portfolio of businesses.

You can whack the URL of the video into GPT4, enable the Video Captions plugin, type the word summarise and get a clean, concise summary of the video like this

This simple process is a great tool for making a quick snap judgement on whether to watch a video for information purposes.

# What do you lose with this approach?

This video looks like it might be an informative, educational video:

So, I whack it into GPT 4 and get a summary, and it looks... kind of useful, nothing groundbreaking, and not very exciting.

Something in the response grabbed my curiosity - why on earth is the guy talking about not drawing in his sketchbook for 2 years at the start of a video about how to make videos?

I decided to check it out. I would recommend you take a few moments to enjoy this video, it's a total masterpiece:

The art.. the creativity... it all gets abstracted away.

I see this as a miniature reminder of a broader lesson.

Steve Jobs shared this idea that the computer is like a bicycle for the mind. It allows us to go faster and further in a more efficient way. Don't lose sight of the human!

> I think one of the things that really separates us from the high primates is that we’re tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least energy to move a kilometer. And, humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing, about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn’t look so good. But, then somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And, a man on a bicycle, a human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the charts.  
> And that’s what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it’s the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with, and it’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.” - Steve Jobs
