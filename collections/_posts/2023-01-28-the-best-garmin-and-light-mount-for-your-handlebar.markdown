For some time now I have wanted the perfect out front mount for my bicycle. Something capable of holding my Garmin Edge 530 and a front light.

I like to use a day time running light when I am out on my bicycle. If it helps a driver spot me a tenth of a second earlier, or pick me out in shadows, just once in years of riding... it could potentially save my life... a bit of a no brainer. All of that said, I don't like having a cluttered handlebar full of gadgets and lighting mounts. I want a clean, simple handlebar on my bike.

Finally... I have found the perfect setup!

My new setup is comprised of three main parts:

  * The K-Edge Combo Mount Anodised (£69.99 from Wiggle) which is a studier version of the standard Garmin computer holder, but with a more aerodynamic profile and a Go-Pro adapter bolted onto the underside. This is the perfect platform to mount an action camera, or a daytime running front light.
  * The Bontrager ION 200 RT Front Light (£38 from Wiggle)
  * The Bontrager Blendr Universal Ion mount (£4.99 from Triton Cycles) which allows you to mount the ION light in the Go-Pro mount on the K-Edge arm



One fun side benefit of this setup is that I discovered the ION light has ANT+ capability. You can pair the light to the Garmin so that when you start a ride on the Garmin it automatically turns the light on. I have found that when I start rides during the day it will set the ION to daytime flash mode. One less button to press before setting out on a ride!
