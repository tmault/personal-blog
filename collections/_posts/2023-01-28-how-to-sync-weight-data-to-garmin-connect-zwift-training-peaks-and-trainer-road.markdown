excerpt: SmartScaleSync.com is a great solution if you are looking to sync Wi-Fi scale weight between various health & training platforms. I use it to keep my weight data automatically synced across Garmin, Training Peaks, Zwift, and Strava.

There is now an easier and free way to do this using FitnessSyncer.com - I will write a new blog post and link it here soon!

[SmartScaleSync.com](http://smartscalesync.com/) is a great solution if you are looking to sync Wi-Fi scale weight between various health & training platforms.

As of 2022 the platform can take weight data from one these sources:

  * Withings
  * Fitbit
  * Garmin Connect



And sync it daily to:

  * TrainerRoad
  * Strava
  * Polar
  * Zwift
  * Peleton
  * Concept 2 (Rowing platform)Fitbit (if not set as the source)
  * Garmin Connect (if not set as the source)



Personally I use a [Withings smart scale](https://amzn.to/3Dh1oIt), synced to:

  * Apple Healthkit via the Withings app
  * TrainerRoad, Strava, and Garmin Connect (connected directly via SmartScaleSync.com)
  * Garmin Connect then passes data on to Training Peaks
  * Zwift directly via the Withings platform (you can set up this sync in the Zwift Companion App on your smartphone)



It took a few minutes to set up SmartScaleSync a few months ago and since then it has ran flawlessly, steadily checking my Withings account for new weight data and syncing it daily. It costs $15 per year but saves the fiddling and hassle of keeping the weight data updated across multiple platforms.
